# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: community-linker 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID/improve

**Description**: I'm making a Membership Portal application for my community group. The Portal has these features:
1. There's a page for members to view all the events and RSVP to events
2. There is a chat for members to talk with eachother in a main group as well as they can message each other
3. A "reputation staking" feature where everyone has 1000 reputation points that they can give to other members, for example I could give 10 people 100 reputation points each. 

The application supports login with web3 wallet. The colors will be navy blue and gold. The users will need to connect their web3 wallet to login.
